# Website-authentication---MVC-desgined---first-attempt-
This is the same project as "website-authentication" project I did before,
a PHP login system, with a slight difference in the way the code is structured. 
This project tried to adapt the concept of MVC design pattern, so the code was siplited into three main parts as MVC suggests. 

The basic project link:
